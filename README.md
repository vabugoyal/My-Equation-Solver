# Gaussian Eliminator
This is an equation solver created by me from scratch. 
This uses Gaussian Elimination to find the solution to a 
system of equations.
You can get the solution to a system of equation which has 
1. Unique Solution
2. No Solution
3. Infinite Solutions

Along with that, you can get the 
rank of the augmented matrix of the 
system and basis, pointing vector, etc.
